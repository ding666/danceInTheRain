When you dance in rain, you will see the rain drops dancing with your rhythm.
Two pledges:
I am going to love myself, forgive myself, be true to myself. I will watch my body grow in the healthy way. I will embrace my soul with joy. When I have desires which could hurt any of them, I look for things or help to make them feel loved.

I'm going out to make some good things happen, to my friends, to my neighbors, to my school, to my community and to the world.
